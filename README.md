## BUSINESS PROBLEM:
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. For example, if Netflix knew a segment of customers who were at risk of churning they could proactively engage them with special offers instead of simply losing them.

## OBJECTIVE and CONSTRAINTS:
- To develop a model for predicting customer churn at a fictitious wireless telecom company .
- Use insights from the model to develop an incentive plan for enticing would-be churners to remain with company.
- The only constraint is interpretability of the model.
- How to further utilise it to take business decison to avoid the customer churn

## APPROACH:
Solving an end to end business problem requres the hypothesis to be tested ,so the strategy I have used is finding the correlating between the variable for getting interaction features after perfroming the initial EDA.
